#### Simulations and other relevant materials for "Identifying microbial drivers in biological phenotypes with a Bayesian Network Regression model".

### Simulation
All files for generating simulations are in the `simulation/` directory.

Simulations are split into two different types: 'realistic' and 'unrealistic'.

Unrealistic simulations are generated by running:

```
simulation/generate_unrealistic_sims.sh [SAMPLESIZE]
```

and realistic simulations are generated by running:

```
simulation/generate_realistic_sims.sh [SAMPLESIZE]
```

where \[SAMPLESIZE\] is the number of samples to generate.
