This folder contains scripts and output for JuliaCon 2021.
The simulations in the `data/` folder are obtained similarly to those described [here](/data/simulation/ReadMe.md), but only 40 total microbes are used, with t=10 and t=20 in each sample. Also, sparsity parameter (for the coefficient matrix) πₛ=0.3 is not used, only πₛ=0.1 and πₛ=0.8 are used.
